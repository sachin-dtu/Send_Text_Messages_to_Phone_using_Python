## Introduction

Sending text messages programmatically can be useful for a wide range of applications, including automated notifications, reminders, and alerts. With Python, we can leverage various APIs and services to send SMS messages directly to mobile devices.

In this project, we'll explore how to send text messages to a phone number using Python. We'll use a simple and straightforward approach that allows you to get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you'll need the following:

1. Python 3.x installed on your system. :snake:
2. A phone number where you want to receive the text messages. :calling:
3. An internet connection to access the SMS service API. :globe_with_meridians:

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it. :inbox_tray:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

2. Install the required Python dependencies using pip. :package:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

1. Open the `send_sms.py` script in a text editor.

2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key obtained from the SMS service provider.

3. Replace `PHONE_NUMBER` with the destination phone number in international format (e.g., +1 for the United States).

4. Customize the `MESSAGE` variable to include your desired text message.

5. Save the changes to the file.

6. Run the Python script. :rocket:

```bash
python send_sms.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should receive the text message on the specified phone number.
